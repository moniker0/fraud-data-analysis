**Approach**
**Data Exploration:** Performed a detailed review of transaction data to uncover potential anomalies and risk factors.
**Trend Analysis:** Investigated hourly, daily, and monthly transaction trends to pinpoint high-risk periods.
**Rule-Based Strategies:** Developed fraud detection rules based on historical patterns to flag risky transactions.
**Projections:** Used simple a forecasting method to anticipate future fraud trends and enhance preventive strategies.

**Interesting Findings**
