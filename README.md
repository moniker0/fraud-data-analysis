**Objective**
The goal of this analysis is to understand patterns and trends in transaction and fraud data, identify high-risk behaviors, and develop strategies to minimize financial losses.

**Approach**
**Data Exploration:** Performed a detailed review of transaction data to uncover potential anomalies and risk factors.
**Trend Analysis:** Investigated hourly, daily, and monthly transaction trends to pinpoint high-risk periods.
**Rule-Based Strategies:** Developed fraud detection rules based on historical patterns to flag risky transactions.
**Projections:** Used simple a forecasting method to anticipate future fraud trends and enhance preventive strategies.

**Interesting Findings**
**Transaction Amount Distribution:**
  - Most transactions are concentrated in lower ranges, but significant outliers (high-value transactions) indicate potential risks.    
  - High-value transactions skew the distribution, emphasizing the need for enhanced monitoring of such cases.
